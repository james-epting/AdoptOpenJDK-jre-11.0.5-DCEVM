# AdoptOpenJDK-jre-11.0.5-DCEVM

The files in this project are Java Runtime Environments from AdoptOpenJDK 11.0.5 with the DCEVM from TravaJDK 11.0.5 added

To use the DCEVM JRE, point to it to be used by your application as a JRE. While your application is running you can make changes to it and then see those changes take effect by recompiling the changed classes.

There is also some example Java code here to illustrate what DCEVM can do, the java example can be run as a Console Application. This sample code mimics an application server, it has a 30 second start up, and 5 minute run time. Here you can make changes and watch the "log activity" reflect those changes. Don't forget to point to the DCEVM JRE, and to recompile your classes!
